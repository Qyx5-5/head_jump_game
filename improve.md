# Game Improvement Plan and Progress

This document outlines the plan for improving the "Head Jump Game" and tracks the progress made.

## Initial Plan

The initial plan focused on enhancing gameplay and visuals:

**Phase 1: Gameplay Enhancements (Innovating on Similar Games)**
*   **Goal:** Introduce mechanics beyond simple jumping to increase engagement and challenge.
*   **Inspiration:** Chrome Dino, Flappy Bird, Jetpack Joyride.
*   **Step 1: Introduce Obstacle Variety & Ducking:** Add obstacles requiring the player to stay grounded (e.g., high obstacles) or potentially duck. Modify input/player logic accordingly.
*   **Step 2: Implement Power-ups:** Add collectable power-ups (e.g., Invincibility, Slow-Motion, Score Multiplier) with visual feedback and timed durations.
*   **Step 3: Refine Difficulty Scaling:** Implement more dynamic difficulty progression beyond just speed increases (e.g., faster spawning, complex patterns).

**Phase 2: Asset Creation & Visual Upgrade**
*   **Goal:** Replace placeholder graphics with custom, visually appealing assets fitting a cohesive theme (proposed: Pixel Art).
*   **Step 1: Design Core Sprites:** Create sprite sheets for the player (idle, jump, run), different obstacle types, and power-ups.
*   **Step 2: Create Background Elements:** Design background layers for parallax scrolling to add depth.
*   **Step 3: Integrate Assets:** Update the game to load and draw the new sprite assets and backgrounds.

## Progress Summary

Here's what has been implemented so far:

1.  **Obstacle Variety (Phase 1, Step 1 partially complete):**
    *   Added configuration (`config.json`) for different obstacle types (`low_cactus`, `flying_rock`) with properties like color, size, and vertical position (`ground`/`air`).
    *   Included obstacle patterns and difficulty settings in the configuration.
    *   Updated `ConfigManager` to correctly load these new configuration sections.
    *   Modified the `Renderer` to draw obstacles based on their specific type, color, and y-position.
    *   Adjusted `GameEngine` collision logic (`_check_collisions`) to handle 'air' obstacles differently (only collide if the player is jumping).

2.  **Power-Up System (Phase 1, Step 2 complete):**
    *   Added configuration (`config.json`) for multiple power-up types (`score_boost`, `invincibility`, `slow_motion`) with properties like spawn chance, duration, color, and effect magnitude.
    *   Updated `GameEngine` to manage power-up state (active type, timer, invincibility status, slow motion factor).
    *   Implemented spawning logic (`_spawn_powerups`) to randomly choose available power-ups and prevent simultaneous activation.
    *   Implemented collision handling (`_handle_powerup_collision`) to activate the correct effect based on the collected power-up type.
    *   Integrated power-up effects into game mechanics:
        *   Invincibility (`is_invincible`) skips obstacle collision checks.
        *   Slow Motion (`slow_motion_factor`) modifies obstacle and power-up speeds.
        *   Score Boost (`score_multiplier`) increases score gain.
    *   Added duration checks (`_check_powerup_duration`) and deactivation logic (`_deactivate_powerup`).
    *   Updated `Renderer` to display status text (`_draw_active_powerup_info`) for active power-ups.

3.  **Procedural Asset Placeholders (Phase 2, Step 1 technically started):**
    *   Created an `AssetManager` (`src/utils/asset_manager.py`) to procedurally generate simple placeholder graphics (Pygame Surfaces) for the player, obstacles, and power-ups using basic shapes and colors defined in the config.
    *   Integrated `AssetManager` into the core game loop (`VideoProcessor`), `GameEngine`, and `Renderer`.
    *   Updated the `Player` entity to use the generated asset surface for its appearance.
    *   Modified the `Renderer` to `blit` these generated assets instead of drawing primitive shapes directly.
    *   Updated the player invincibility visual effect to use transparency (`set_alpha`) on the player's asset surface.

4.  **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Resolved Python 3.10+ type hint incompatibility (`| None`) by using `typing.Optional` for Python 3.8 compatibility in `AssetManager`.
    *   Fixed an `AttributeError` during game reset by adding a `reset()` method to the `Player` class.
    *   Addressed a `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object` by improving the robustness of return value handling in `VideoProcessor.process_frame`.

## Next Steps

Potential next steps include:

1.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the implemented obstacle variations and power-up system.
2.  **Refine Difficulty Scaling (Phase 1, Step 3):** Analyze and improve the `_update_difficulty` logic in `GameEngine`.
3.  **Refine Procedural Assets:** Enhance the visual complexity of the procedurally generated assets in `AssetManager`.
4.  **Implement Real Assets (Phase 2):** Start creating/finding pixel art sprites and integrate them by modifying `AssetManager` to load image files.
5.  **Implement Ducking (Phase 1, Step 1):** Add the ducking mechanic if desired.
